  The potential routine in POTLIB assumes a
  default labeling of the atoms.  The user has
  made the following selection of atomic labels:

               DEFAULT                         USER-SELECTED

  Atom  1 is       N                                   N 
  Atom  2 is       H                                   H 
  Atom  3 is       H                                   H 
  Atom  4 is       H                                   H 


  Atom  1  N  is a member of Reactant #1
  Atom  2  H  is a member of Reactant #1
  Atom  3  H  is a member of Reactant #1
  Atom  4  H  is a member of Reactant #2

  The Potential Energy is Zero for the following
  geometric arrangement:  The reactants are at
  their equilibrium geometries, widely separated.


  Reactant #1
  N H H 

  Reactant #2
  H 

  The default units are:
     BOHR FOR DISTANCE
     HARTREE FOR ENERGY


  The user has chosen units :
     BOHR                 FOR DISTANCE
     HARTREE              FOR ENERGY


  To reset the zero-of-energy, assign a
  non-zero value to the variable ANUZERO.
  The value of ANUZERO will be SUBTRACTED from
  the energy calculated by this routine.
