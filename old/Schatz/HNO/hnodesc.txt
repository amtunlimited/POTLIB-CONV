The following is a list of files needed:

hnosurf.f	
noh.d	
onh.d
quadhno1.d
quadhno2.d
quadhno3.d
quadnoh1.d
quadnoh2.d
quadnoh3.d
spline1d.d
spline2d.d
spline3d.d

hnosurf.f is the potential fortran code, and all the 
data files containing parameters needed in the coded
follow.  There should be eleven data files.  The last
line in the data file gives the name of the file used
in the open statements in the code.  If you change the 
name of the files, you must edit the open statements.
Comment statements in the code describe how to use it.
