The following is a list of files needed:

hnnosurf.f	
noh.d	
onh.d
spline2d.1d
dream
dream2
coefhn2

hnnosurf.f is the potential fortran code, and all the 
data files containing parameters needed in the code
follow.  There should be six data files.  The last
line in the data file gives the name of the file used
in the open statements in the code.  If you change the 
name of the files, you must edit the open statements.
Comment statements in the code describe how to use it.
